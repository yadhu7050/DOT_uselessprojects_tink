    <h3>An Introductory Course on Putting Things Off Efficiently</h3>
    <p>Welcome to <em>Procrastination 101</em>, where the motto is “Why do it today when you can do it… eventually?” This course is a deep dive into the refined, timeless art of avoiding tasks. Key concepts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Magic of the Last Minute:</b> Understand why waiting until the eleventh hour unleashes your <em>true potential</em>. After all, “under pressure” is just another word for “optimal productivity.”</li>
        <li><b>Scrolling in Perpetuity:</b> Learn how social media, online videos, and infinite memes can provide endless justifications for doing absolutely nothing productive.</li>
        <li><b>Mastering Excuses:</b> Develop a robust collection of reasons for why you “just haven’t gotten to it yet.” Includes bonus excuses like “I work better under pressure” and “I just need to get into the right headspace.”</li>
        <li><b>“Urgent” Low-Priority Tasks:</b> Become an expert at suddenly finding minor, inconsequential jobs (like organizing a drawer) to avoid your real responsibilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Assignments? We encourage you to start them at the end of the semester… if at all. Remember: the only thing that’s truly urgent is delaying tasks effectively!</p>
